# Welcome to CN Tower Lights API

This API shows the current CN Tower's color agenda (üìç Toronto, Canada) according to its official webpage.  
  
## Motivation
I wondered what the reasons were to CN Tower shows distinct colors every night. Then I found the official agenda and its appointments to celebrate notable events and dates. As a nerd web developer, I created this API when didn't discover the official one.  

## How it works

After user calls the API requesting the schedule:  
If the current date is on the database, it returns the agenda  
If else, it scrapes the official schedule and saves on the database. Then the method returns the agenda to the user.
